# Stress Detector

A machine learning project for detecting stress using physiological signals from wearable sensors.

## Project Structure

- `data/` - Dataset storage (raw, interim, processed)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploration and experimentation
- `src/` - Source code for data processing, feature extraction, and modeling
- `experiments/` - Experiment results and configurations
- `demo/` - Demo scripts and sample data

## Datasets

This project uses three datasets:
- **WESAD** - Wearable Stress and Affect Detection
- **SRAD** - Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers
- **SWELL** - SWELL Knowledge Work dataset

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or using conda:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate stress-detector
```

## Usage

See notebooks for detailed examples and workflows.
